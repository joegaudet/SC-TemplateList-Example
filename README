This is an example of three different types of collections that I think should
be able to produce more or less the same result. However they do not. The first
list is a standard old school type list, which works as expected. The second list
works but does not bind to the content properly. And the third list creates an
error at 'compile time' that renders the app unusable.

Thoughts ?
